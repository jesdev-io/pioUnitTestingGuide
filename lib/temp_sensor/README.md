# `temp_sensor` module

This module implements a portable *fake* communication with a fictional temperature sensor communicating via the UART protocol. The functions provide fake data (mock-ups) because this repository acts as an educational guide and blueprint for unit tests. This way, you can run this code **without** having to connect any real peripherals or sensors.
